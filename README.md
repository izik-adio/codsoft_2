# Simple Calculator

Welcome to the Simple Calculator project! This Python application allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through a user-friendly command-line interface.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear instructions and prompts guide users through the calculation process.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures smooth operation, even when users input invalid values or choices.
- **Division by Zero Handling**: Graceful handling of division by zero errors prevents crashes and provides helpful feedback to users.
- **Modular Design**: Separation of concerns between the `main.py` and `utilities.py` files promotes code reusability and maintainability.
- **Utilization of Python 3.10 Features**: Leveraging the new `match` statement introduced in Python 3.10 for cleaner and more concise code.
